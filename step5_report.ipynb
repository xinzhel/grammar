He leads the Asia   Pacific team of Lynxx, a data analytics and operations research consultancy with deep  experience in railway modelling, including through the development of their own simulation  and timetable optimisation software that is now exported to railways across the world.  Through Lynxx, Matt leads complex econometric, statistical & operational advice for railway  clients across the world (including Auckland and Wellington) using advanced analytics tools  and simulation software. He is extremely well versed in the Auckland railway network and in  modelling tools for the planning and performance of railways.

His team used a generalised journey time model (based on the UK's  Passenger Demand Forecasting Handbook for rail patronage prediction) to prepare  a large number of potential scenarios, and then narrow them down by operational  feasibility. This is relevant to the Auckland context given the requirement to develop  complex patronage forecasts and given the Covid uncertainty that may apply.  Regional Express Rail | Ontario, CA | Deutsche Bahn International | 2019 -  Present | Economic Growth and Timetable Optimisation Lead  Matt is leading the econometric and operational optimisation for DB International's  tender to run the Ontario regional express rail. His team is building innovative  economic growth forecasts and operations research-based optimisation models, in  which an algorithm generates mathematically perfect timetables given a set of  operational constraints. This project evaluates potential rail patronage and operating  concepts up to 2055 for the entire Ontario region, and utilises passenger demand  forecasting handbook 'generalised journey time' models. Lynxx has custom-built  railway optimisation software to maximise economic benefit and minimise costs.  This approach is offered as an innovation to the Auckland RUS/LTPP approach.    Auckland Rail Operations | Auckland | Transdev | 2019 - Present | Operational  Modelling Projects  Matt has been engaged to support Transdev Auckland in its rail operational  modelling, including the provision of live tools to monitor day to day operations in the  control centre and simulation software to predict the KPI of future timetable.  Matt and his team are providing multiple layers of timetable and operational  modelling advice, assessing KPI performance before agreeing to operational  timetables. Lynxx has been able to generate insights not available in traditional  timetabling tools (which are geared much more towards infrastructure evaluation,  than operational KPIs).   This shows a highly developed understanding of the Auckland network already,  meaning the Lynxx & Aurecon team will benefit from a very rapid deployment of  modelling software and a comprehensive understanding of the end customers.      City Rail Link | Auckland | Transdev | 2020 | Operational Modelling Advice  Matt and the Lynxx team are supporting Transdev, AT and CRLL with operational  modelling and predictions of performance under different CRL timetable models,  including construction blockades.

He leads the Asia   Pacific team of Lynxx, a data analytics and operations research consultancy with deep  experience in railway modelling, including through the development of their own simulation  and timetable optimisation software that is now exported to railways across the world.  Through Lynxx, Matt leads complex econometric, statistical & operational advice for railway  clients across the world (including Auckland and Wellington) using advanced analytics tools  and simulation software. He is extremely well versed in the Auckland railway network and in  modelling tools for the planning and performance of railways.   Qualifications and Technical and Management Skills   Position and  Organisation   Managing Director for Asia Pacific, Lynxx   Location   Sydney   •  Master of Science (Economics - dissertation on the link between   railway operational performance and passenger demand),  London   •  Bachelor of Science (Psychology), Otago   Qualifications   •  Bachelor of Commerce (Management, Marketing), Otago   •  Graduate Microcredential (Data Science: Data-Driven Decision   Making), Monash University   •  Prince2 Project Management Foundation   •  European Foundation for Quality Management Assessor   •  Graduate of the Australian Institute of Company Directors   •  Extensive leadership skills (project, people)   Management Skills   •  Programme Management    •  Analysis & interpretation of complex data   Technical Skills   •  Econometrician (railway modelling)   •  Railway operations expert   Contract  Commitment   Fully available throughout project and 100% committed where  required   b (1) Experience   Lower North Island Rolling Stock Business Case | Wellington (remote  delivery) | Greater Wellington Regional Council | 2001 | Demand Modelling  Lead  Matt was engaged to support the Lower North Island rolling stock business case by  developing passenger demand forecasting and advanced operation scenario  mapping. His team used a generalised journey time model (based on the UK's  Passenger Demand Forecasting Handbook for rail patronage prediction) to prepare  a large number of potential scenarios, and then narrow them down by operational  feasibility. This is relevant to the Auckland context given the requirement to develop  complex patronage forecasts and given the Covid uncertainty that may apply.  Regional Express Rail | Ontario, CA | Deutsche Bahn International | 2019 -  Present | Economic Growth and Timetable Optimisation Lead  Matt is leading the econometric and operational optimisation for DB International's  tender to run the Ontario regional express rail. His team is building innovative  economic growth forecasts and operations research-based optimisation models, in  which an algorithm generates mathematically perfect timetables given a set of  operational constraints. This project evaluates potential rail patronage and operating  concepts up to 2055 for the entire Ontario region, and utilises passenger demand  forecasting handbook 'generalised journey time' models. Lynxx has custom-built  railway optimisation software to maximise economic benefit and minimise costs.  This approach is offered as an innovation to the Auckland RUS/LTPP approach.    Auckland Rail Operations | Auckland | Transdev | 2019 - Present | Operational  Modelling Projects  Matt has been engaged to support Transdev Auckland in its rail operational  modelling, including the provision of live tools to monitor day to day operations in the  control centre and simulation software to predict the KPI of future timetable.  Matt and his team are providing multiple layers of timetable and operational  modelling advice, assessing KPI performance before agreeing to operational  timetables. Lynxx has been able to generate insights not available in traditional  timetabling tools (which are geared much more towards infrastructure evaluation,  than operational KPIs).   This shows a highly developed understanding of the Auckland network already,  meaning the Lynxx & Aurecon team will benefit from a very rapid deployment of  modelling software and a comprehensive understanding of the end customers.      City Rail Link | Auckland | Transdev | 2020 | Operational Modelling Advice  Matt and the Lynxx team are supporting Transdev, AT and CRLL with operational  modelling and predictions of performance under different CRL timetable models,  including construction blockades.

He leads the Asia   Pacific team of Lynxx, a data analytics and operations research consultancy with deep  experience in railway modelling, including through the development of their own simulation  and timetable optimisation software that is now exported to railways across the world.  Through Lynxx, Matt leads complex econometric, statistical & operational advice for railway  clients across the world (including Auckland and Wellington) using advanced analytics tools  and simulation software. He is extremely well versed in the Auckland railway network and in  modelling tools for the planning and performance of railways.

His team used a generalised journey time model (based on the UK's  Passenger Demand Forecasting Handbook for rail patronage prediction) to prepare  a large number of potential scenarios, and then narrow them down by operational  feasibility. This is relevant to the Auckland context given the requirement to develop  complex patronage forecasts and given the Covid uncertainty that may apply.  Regional Express Rail | Ontario, CA | Deutsche Bahn International | 2019 -  Present | Economic Growth and Timetable Optimisation Lead  Matt is leading the econometric and operational optimisation for DB International's  tender to run the Ontario regional express rail. His team is building innovative  economic growth forecasts and operations research-based optimisation models, in  which an algorithm generates mathematically perfect timetables given a set of  operational constraints. This project evaluates potential rail patronage and operating  concepts up to 2055 for the entire Ontario region, and utilises passenger demand  forecasting handbook 'generalised journey time' models. Lynxx has custom-built  railway optimisation software to maximise economic benefit and minimise costs.  This approach is offered as an innovation to the Auckland RUS/LTPP approach.    Auckland Rail Operations | Auckland | Transdev | 2019 - Present | Operational  Modelling Projects  Matt has been engaged to support Transdev Auckland in its rail operational  modelling, including the provision of live tools to monitor day to day operations in the  control centre and simulation software to predict the KPI of future timetable.  Matt and his team are providing multiple layers of timetable and operational  modelling advice, assessing KPI performance before agreeing to operational  timetables. Lynxx has been able to generate insights not available in traditional  timetabling tools (which are geared much more towards infrastructure evaluation,  than operational KPIs).   This shows a highly developed understanding of the Auckland network already,  meaning the Lynxx & Aurecon team will benefit from a very rapid deployment of  modelling software and a comprehensive understanding of the end customers.      City Rail Link | Auckland | Transdev | 2020 | Operational Modelling Advice  Matt and the Lynxx team are supporting Transdev, AT and CRLL with operational  modelling and predictions of performance under different CRL timetable models,  including construction blockades.

If you could  provide some further details about the  location and scope of the work, that would  be useful.  I will also make some enquiries regarding  alternative employment agencies, however  at this stage I am only aware of First Sun  having been used in this capacity.   Thanks for getting back to me promptly.  The work is likely to take 1-2 days, would  involve field survey, and was planned for  somewhere in the week of 24 September.   We could try and arrange this for Thursday  and Friday 27 and 28 September, but  would this give enough notice to site  officers with the FRG on the 26th?  I\"ll check with First Sun if they\"re happy to  organise payment for site officers.   Thanks Jo.  I will have a discussion with  Annika Rotumah, our Community  Facilitator, when she is in the office  tomorrow about the best logistical means  to proceed.   Thanks Tori    I\"ve had a last-minute cancellation for next  week, and there\"s a possibility for us to do  a quick survey of a potential ancillary area  near a women\"s site near New Italy, I was  wondering if there might be a possibility to  arrange to get Veronica Wilson and/or Kim  Wilson, and/or another female member of  Bandjalang People out to look at this area  next week (17-21 September) sometime?   I realise this is before the preferred date of  the FRG meeting you mentioned on the  26th, but thought I\"d check.  At this stage  we\"re pretty flexible with timing next week,  just not Wednesday morning, but we could  do pretty much any time Monday,  Tuesday, Weds afternoon, Thursday or  Friday.  We also need to invite Bogal  LALC, so timing may be somewhat  constrained depending on their availability  too.  I haven\"t heard back from First Sun yet,  but another possibility we could explore for  getting Bandjalang People site officers  paid would potentially be through Bogal  LALC - I\"m speaking to Lance Manton  (CEO) this afternoon and could run this by  him.   NTSCORP has spoken to Kim & Bonnie  Wilson, and to Aunty Gwen Hickling, who  have given their consent for us to pass on  their contact details to you to facilitate this  work next week at a suitable time.

Located in the heart of Melbourne (at the former site of the Royal Women\\'s  Hospital), this is a hub for world-class university expertise and talent, start-ups, SMEs, government and industry. Melbourne Connect brings together digital expertise of industry leaders and Melbourne University under one roof.  Project background - Melbourne Connect (MC) is a \\'purpose built\\' innovation and technology precinct developed by the University of Melbourne in  partnership with a consortium led by Lendlease. The Precinct is  right in the heart of Carlton and next to the Parkville campus and Biomedical precinct. Via  people, place and programs, the idea is that MC will generate digitally driven, data enabled, and socially responsible solutions addressing the big challenges  facing society. MC tenants will be able to expertise in digital technology including AI, data science, and  robotics, drawing on the University\\'s expertise  to  drive innovation and new technologies across all sectors. In terms of the \\'nuts and bolts\\', there are already a bunch of innovation labs under development  specifically designed to tackle these challenges including zero emissions energy, digital twins, digital health and the future of work.   Vision - the vision is for MC to be a \\'gateway to world-changing expertise\\'. By enhancing research and education, MC  will support the vision of Melbourne  as a \\'Knowledge City\\' and play an important role within the Melbourne Innovation Districts (innovation partnership with Melbourne Uni, RMIT and the City   of Melbourne). The plan is for MC to be a \\'digital and data science powerhouse\\' in the heart of the city. It will be home to over 3,000 knowledge workers  from corporate innovation leaders, government, social ventures, start-ups and SMEs alongside diverse digitally focused university expertise, creatives, and  graduate talent. This includes the Telstra Creator Space (a prototyping facility and fabrication space), Science Gallery Melbourne and Melbourne  Entrepreneurial Centre. The new mixed-use precinct will create more than 3,000 direct jobs and more than 5,000 indirect jobs.  Stakeholders - The two key players in this story are \\'host\\' and main delivery vehicle Melbourne Uni and from a financing/investing perspective, Lendlease.   Roles and Responsibilities - the Lendlease consortium comprised Lendlease as developer, builder, co-investor and investment manager of the commercial  space; GIC as major co-investor of the commercial space; Spotless as the facilities manager; and Urbanest as investor and manager of the student  accommodation. Melbourne University is the host and creative hub. The two commercial buildings in the precinct are intended to provide workspace  accommodation for academics, researchers, industry as well as start-ups. The Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology together with its  Fabrication Laboratory and Human Computer Interaction Labs will be have an anchor presence in this precinct, utilising office spaces across 8 floors of the  high raise commercial building. Interestingly, as Melbourne Uni\\'s \\'development partner\\', AECOM was heavily involved in the design and technical  construction advisory of the project. Melbourne Uni  also has a strategic partnership with Invest VIC. The intent is for the two organisations to collaborate to  identify and attract new and strategic FDI with the potential to be located at priority precincts (including MC).  Funding - once again, this is a mix of public and private capital. Lendlease is supplying a lot of the MC development capital together with a consortium of  investors. Project value was estimated at $425m, covering design, construct and maintain over the 40 year + lifecycle.  What about Government? The VIC  Government has contributed start-up capital to establish several of the innovation labs. The $15.2m package will help establish the Zero Emissions Energy  Lab and the Digital Twin Data Visualisation Lab - a visual workspace for major infrastructure project collaboration, and the Digital Health Validtron that will  replicate clinical and home environments for the development of medical devices. While it\\'s not explicit, the likelihood is that this State funding came from  the Victorian Higher Education State Investment Fund, set up in response to the significant impact of the pandemic on the education sector. The presence of  the Melbourne Entrepreneurial Centre at MC also suggests some funding from the Melbourne Accelerator Program (MAP).  MAP has raised over $250m and  invested in over 240 start-ups since inception in 2012. MAP is a 5-month full-time program which provides start-ups with $20,000 in equity-free funding,  free office space in the CBD, structured mentoring by entrepreneurs and business leaders, and pitching opportunities to investors and business leaders in  Australia and overseas.

Essentially, the strategy for the early stages involves:   \\uf0b7  Developing a performance brief and concept design level information to facilitate the Tenderer/s to   assess the construction costs.    \\uf0b7   In parallel with the Tenderer/s pricing the project we propose to further the design into the Design  Development phase, which will enable further detail to be provided to the Tenderer/s, thereby  addressing queries likely to arise, and giving greater cost certainty. It also gives an opportunity to  incorporate refinements initiated by the Tenderer/s.       \\uf0b7  Once the Contractor is appointed the Design Development phase would be completed with their   involvement, achieving a level of design progression suitable for tenant negotiations.   Working in a Novation / D&C Environment  We enjoy working with contractors in a D&C environment and have done so on numerous projects,  with recent examples including 717 Bourke Street, 850 Collins St, 567 Collins St, Swanston Square  and Freshwater Place 2.    We favour working in a D&C environment because:   \\uf0b7  We are able to have early engagement with the contractor on the objectives for the design. \\n\\n[ identifying opportunities May 2021](https://aurecongroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Knowledge/Insights/Australia\\'s%20research%20sector%20-%20identifying%20opportunities%20May%202021.pdf):\\nNSW Precincts  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  One feature of the \\'innovation economy\\' has been the increasing importance of  concentrating businesses in specific geographic areas to match skills, to collaborate, or to  share knowledge and resources in a cost-effective way.

Project background - Latrobe University has a Research and Innovation Precinct located 14 km from Melbourne CBD  and halfway between city centre and outer north Melbourne. Latrobe is investing and building a connected ecosystem  of industry, academia and community to create a regional innovation hub. The intent is to foster economic growth and  achieve \\'global impact\\' across the Health & Wellbeing; Agriculture, Food & Environment; and Digital Transformation  domains.   Vision - Latrobe has ambitious plans to build a \"university city of the future\", framed around innovation and  collaboration with industry and research organisations. This will be a co-location home for leading research groups,  start-ups, government agencies and multinational companies. The strategy hinges on leveraging (and developing)  Latrobe\\'s existing Research and Innovation Precinct  to enable industry to co-locate on campus. This will create a vibrant  hub of opportunity, engagement and collaboration through the entire research and innovation value chain. Ultimately  the \"University of the Future\" will transform the university campus into multiple precinct opportunities  (health/wellbeing, sports, innovation and research).  Stakeholders - there are a whole bunch of precinct partners from entrepreneurs through to industry, academics,  educators and the local community. Precinct partners include Rio Tinto, Agriculture Australia, GeneWorks, NorthLink,  Solvay, Photon Systems, Cornerstone and WEHI (one of Australia\\'s leading biomedical research organisations).  Roles and Responsibilities - from what I can see Latrobe\\'s Research and Innovation precinct primarily works as an  enabler vehicle via research collaboration, talent pipeline, start-up programs and product/service development. The  Precinct ecosystem empowers innovators and emerging companies all the way from concept through to  commercialisation, scale-up and acceleration. So far, it has helped partner companies raise $30m with joint investment  from government and industry, and co-developed IP. It\\'s supported by Latrobe\\'s Office of Industry Engagement which  facilitates strategic collaborations through sponsored research, international research collaborations, licensing, patents  and commercialisation.  Funding - On its website, Latrobe says that the University City of the Future will require $5b investment from the  Government and private sector.  There\\'s been some Government investment already. We know Government has  committed $40m to support the economic diversification and growth of the LaTrobe Valley Innovation Hub.   Latrobe NEIC - Latrobe is a NEIC too, billed as a \\'Digital Innovation Hub\\' connecting La Trobe University and its  technology partners with businesses to provide world-leading expertise in food, agriculture, health and digital  technologies. The NEIC is all about generating employment and economic growth in Melbourne\\'s north-eastern suburbs  via co-ordinated public and private investments in infrastructure. The cluster has strengths in education, research,  health and retail. The vision is for Latrobe to become an \\'integrated, hyper-productive city\\', creating jobs in  education/research, health (Austin Health is one of the key institutions) and advanced manufacturing. This will be  accompanied by strategic investments in critical transport infra (roads, rail), amenities and \\'sustainable initiatives\\' to  accelerate regional economic growth. Planning for the La Trobe NEIC will be done by the VPA in conjunction with the  DJPR and will set clear objectives for the precinct\\'s future.   Opportunities at Heidelberg West - Nearby Heidelberg west industrial precinct will become a modern business  environment with new offices and research and development premises including advanced manufacturing that relates  to La Trobe University and supports a growing residential community with new tree lined street networks for public  transport, pedestrians and cyclists.\\n\\n[Aurecon Response to Narrabri SAP Package C Environment and Heritage](https://aurecongroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Knowledge/WinningWork/Aurecon%20Response%20to%20Narrabri%20SAP%20Package%20C%20Environment%20and%20Heritage.pdf):\\n-11     30 \\n\\n[Otakaro Avon River Corridor Programme_cleansed](https://aurecongroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Knowledge/WinningWork/Otakaro%20Avon%20River%20Corridor%20Programme_cleansed.pdf):\\n   1 \\n\\n[Victorian Precincts Unpacking the opportunities  ](https://aurecongroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Knowledge/Insights/Victorian%20Precincts%20Unpacking%20the%20opportunities%20%20.pdf):\\nMonash  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  The pitch - where globally connected change-makers, innovators and enterprise converge, transforming research into  tangible solutions. Research with impact.  Project background - Located in Clayton, the Monash Technology Precinct is a core element of the Monash innovation  cluster.  It\\'s a Technology Precinct focused on Advanced MFG, Future technologies, health and education. The Precinct\\'s  advanced manufacturing capability provides jobs across a broad spectrum of manufacturing types and is home to over  70% percent of Victoria\\'s high value and advanced manufacturing. The precinct has leading engineering design and  research capabilities in technologies like AI, 3D printing, future materials and processes, next generation therapeutics  and advanced robotics. There\\'s also a big sustainable development aspect with Monash building an on-site microgrid at  the university campus in the precinct.  Vision - all about creating a world class ecosystem of knowledge and innovation where Monash and its connected  partners collaborate to \\'push the boundaries\\'. This is a future that extends beyond a commercial hub and one of a  liveable, connected city. Over the next 20 years, Monash wants to be  the globally recognised centre of industry,  research and education collaboration.  By 2050, more than 500 globally-significant businesses will be operating here  Stakeholders - this is another hugely complicated ecosystem of research organisations (i.e., CSIRO), education  institutions, industry, SMEs and various Government agencies all collaborating under the umbrella of technology.  Enterprise partners range from tech start ups through to multinationals. Notable collaborations include the Woodside  Innovation Centre (a technology innovation hub for engineering), the J&J Innovation Partnering Office and the Public  Transport Research Group, a partnership with Public Transport Victoria (PTV).  Roles and Responsibilities - just like the Latrobe innovation precinct, the Monash tech precinct is an enabling vehicle. It  enables world class R&D by driving the collaboration of its centres, platforms and facilities with key government and  industry players.  Funding - this is likely to be a mix of Government investment capital (via strategic growth programs, investment funds  and grants etc) and private sector development capital. We know for example that Monash University received $17.5m  in funding through the State Government\\'s VHESIF to establish Victoria\\'s Health Innovation Centre in the Monash  Technology Precinct (MTP). Monash also secured $16.1m of funding via the VHESIF towards smart manufacturing, and  R&D commercialisation. The smart MFG funding will drive commercial and entrepreneurial activity across the MTP.  Monash NEIC - many of the university led precincts are also NEICs. Monash is no exception, described by Invest Victoria  as a \\'thriving hub of health, technology and business precincts, educational institutions and commercial operations\\'.  Monash is Melbourne\\'s largest established national employment and innovation cluster, with a mix of education,  research and industry organisations. As well as being the largest concentration of jobs outside of the CBD, Monash is  viewed as the \\'foundation for the growth of knowledge industries\\'. Focus will be on improving critical economic and  social infrastructure, encouraging new services and businesses to set up and partnership groups to coordinate business  attraction and investment. As with the other NEICs, planning for the Monash NEIC will be done by the VPA in  conjunction with the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions (DJPR).\\n\\n[ Aurecon - KHUB](https://aurecongroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Knowledge/WinningWork/STEMM%20Hub%20&%20Life%20Sciences%20Precinct%20PM%20Services%20-%20Aurecon%20-%20KHUB.pdf):\\nSTEMM HUB + Life  Sciences Precinct  STEMM HUB + Life Sciences  Precinct - Safety in Design and  Project Management Approach   The University of Melbourne    18 December 2019 \\n\\n[ identifying opportunities May 2021](https://aurecongroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Knowledge/Insights/Australia\\'s%20research%20sector%20-%20identifying%20opportunities%20May%202021.pdf):\\nVIC Precincts  •  •  •  •  •  •  VIC also has several innovation precincts, defined by the Vic Planning Authority as  \"areas where leading-edge anchor institutions and companies cluster and connect  with start-ups, business incubators and accelerators.\"   As with NSW, there\\'s a very strong research narrative at play. They touch similar  research-intensive sectors too - health, education, Aerospace & Defence and  Advanced Manufacturing.....the interplay of science and industry.  Melbourne Biomedical Precinct  - biomedical innovation and research precinct in  Parkville. Contains some of the biggest global names in the biomedical sector and  an excellent environment for research based commercial activity. R&D  infrastructure make it a highly sought-after destination by global companies and  research institutions. Attracts more annual competitive biomedical research  funding than any other area in Australia.$2.8b MBP capital directed into research  and healthcare facilities over past decade. Located in the MBP, Illumina and the  University of Melbourne have partnered to establish the Illumina-University of  Melbourne Genomics Hub - the first in the Asia Pacific - which will bring together  the best of genomic expertise and technology in Australia.  Arden - knowledge and innovation hub for life sciences, health, digital technology  and education in Melbourne. Arden is an urban renewal precinct with a strong  research and innovation focus.  Intent is to compliment the neighbouring Parkville  biomedical innovation and research precinct and turn North Melbourne into an  employment hub for science, health, education and digital technology.  Melbourne Connect - purpose built innovation precinct being developed by the  University of Melbourne in partnership with a consortium led by Lendlease.  Located within an innovation cluster, Melbourne Connect will be a place to co- locate and collaborate with world-leaders in deep tech and digital futures research.  Areas of focus will be AI, autonomous systems, sustainable infrastructure,  renewable energy and information systems.  Fisherman\\'s Bend Employment Precinct - creating 21st century jobs centred on  innovation, entrepreneurship and design excellence in manufacturing. T he  presence of world-leading engineering and design research alongside start-ups,  scale-ups, investors and world-leading industry partners will turbo charge the  collaboration and partnerships that drive innovation.\\n\\n[Victorian Precincts Unpacking the opportunities  ](https://aurecongroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Knowledge/Insights/Victorian%20Precincts%20Unpacking%20the%20opportunities%20%20.pdf):\\nMelbourne Connect  •  •  •  •  •  •  The pitch - \\'where great minds connect, and incredible futures emerge\\'. Located in the heart of Melbourne (at the former site of the Royal Women\\'s  Hospital), this is a hub for world-class university expertise and talent, start-ups, SMEs, government and industry. Melbourne Connect brings together digital expertise of industry leaders and Melbourne University under one roof.  Project background - Melbourne Connect (MC) is a \\'purpose built\\' innovation and technology precinct developed by the University of Melbourne in  partnership with a consortium led by Lendlease. The Precinct is  right in the heart of Carlton and next to the Parkville campus and Biomedical precinct. Via  people, place and programs, the idea is that MC will generate digitally driven, data enabled, and socially responsible solutions addressing the big challenges  facing society. MC tenants will be able to expertise in digital technology including AI, data science, and  robotics, drawing on the University\\'s expertise  to  drive innovation and new technologies across all sectors. In terms of the \\'nuts and bolts\\', there are already a bunch of innovation labs under development  specifically designed to tackle these challenges including zero emissions energy, digital twins, digital health and the future of work.   Vision - the vision is for MC to be a \\'gateway to world-changing expertise\\'. By enhancing research and education, MC  will support the vision of Melbourne  as a \\'Knowledge City\\' and play an important role within the Melbourne Innovation Districts (innovation partnership with Melbourne Uni, RMIT and the City   of Melbourne). The plan is for MC to be a \\'digital and data science powerhouse\\' in the heart of the city. It will be home to over 3,000 knowledge workers  from corporate innovation leaders, government, social ventures, start-ups and SMEs alongside diverse digitally focused university expertise, creatives, and  graduate talent. This includes the Telstra Creator Space (a prototyping facility and fabrication space), Science Gallery Melbourne and Melbourne  Entrepreneurial Centre. The new mixed-use precinct will create more than 3,000 direct jobs and more than 5,000 indirect jobs.  Stakeholders - The two key players in this story are \\'host\\' and main delivery vehicle Melbourne Uni and from a financing/investing perspective, Lendlease.   Roles and Responsibilities - the Lendlease consortium comprised Lendlease as developer, builder, co-investor and investment manager of the commercial  space; GIC as major co-investor of the commercial space; Spotless as the facilities manager; and Urbanest as investor and manager of the student  accommodation. Melbourne University is the host and creative hub. The two commercial buildings in the precinct are intended to provide workspace  accommodation for academics, researchers, industry as well as start-ups. The Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology together with its  Fabrication Laboratory and Human Computer Interaction Labs will be have an anchor presence in this precinct, utilising office spaces across 8 floors of the  high raise commercial building. Interestingly, as Melbourne Uni\\'s \\'development partner\\', AECOM was heavily involved in the design and technical  construction advisory of the project. Melbourne Uni  also has a strategic partnership with Invest VIC. The intent is for the two organisations to collaborate to  identify and attract new and strategic FDI with the potential to be located at priority precincts (including MC).  Funding - once again, this is a mix of public and private capital. Lendlease is supplying a lot of the MC development capital together with a consortium of  investors. Project value was estimated at $425m, covering design, construct and maintain over the 40 year + lifecycle.  What about Government? The VIC  Government has contributed start-up capital to establish several of the innovation labs. The $15.2m package will help establish the Zero Emissions Energy  Lab and the Digital Twin Data Visualisation Lab - a visual workspace for major infrastructure project collaboration, and the Digital Health Validtron that will  replicate clinical and home environments for the development of medical devices. While it\\'s not explicit, the likelihood is that this State funding came from  the Victorian Higher Education State Investment Fund, set up in response to the significant impact of the pandemic on the education sector. The presence of  the Melbourne Entrepreneurial Centre at MC also suggests some funding from the Melbourne Accelerator Program (MAP).  MAP has raised over $250m and  invested in over 240 start-ups since inception in 2012. MAP is a 5-month full-time program which provides start-ups with $20,000 in equity-free funding,  free office space in the CBD, structured mentoring by entrepreneurs and business leaders, and pitching opportunities to investors and business leaders in  Australia and overseas. The VIC state Government also invested $124m to strengthen Australia\\'s capability in AI, including the establishment of a National AI  Centre led by Victorian-based CSIRO Data 61 in the Melbourne Connect Precinct\\n\\n\\n### Question:\\nShow me the location and status for the project called \"Carlton Innovation Precinct\".', 'gpt_response': \"I'm sorry, but I don't have access to real-time information on specific projects or their current status.

Research with impact.  Project background - Located in Clayton, the Monash Technology Precinct is a core element of the Monash innovation  cluster.  It\\'s a Technology Precinct focused on Advanced MFG, Future technologies, health and education. The Precinct\\'s  advanced manufacturing capability provides jobs across a broad spectrum of manufacturing types and is home to over  70% percent of Victoria\\'s high value and advanced manufacturing. The precinct has leading engineering design and  research capabilities in technologies like AI, 3D printing, future materials and processes, next generation therapeutics  and advanced robotics. There\\'s also a big sustainable development aspect with Monash building an on-site microgrid at  the university campus in the precinct.  Vision - all about creating a world class ecosystem of knowledge and innovation where Monash and its connected  partners collaborate to \\'push the boundaries\\'. This is a future that extends beyond a commercial hub and one of a  liveable, connected city. Over the next 20 years, Monash wants to be  the globally recognised centre of industry,  research and education collaboration.  By 2050, more than 500 globally-significant businesses will be operating here  Stakeholders - this is another hugely complicated ecosystem of research organisations (i.e., CSIRO), education  institutions, industry, SMEs and various Government agencies all collaborating under the umbrella of technology.  Enterprise partners range from tech start ups through to multinationals. Notable collaborations include the Woodside  Innovation Centre (a technology innovation hub for engineering), the J&J Innovation Partnering Office and the Public  Transport Research Group, a partnership with Public Transport Victoria (PTV).  Roles and Responsibilities - just like the Latrobe innovation precinct, the Monash tech precinct is an enabling vehicle. It  enables world class R&D by driving the collaboration of its centres, platforms and facilities with key government and  industry players.  Funding - this is likely to be a mix of Government investment capital (via strategic growth programs, investment funds  and grants etc) and private sector development capital. We know for example that Monash University received $17.5m  in funding through the State Government\\'s VHESIF to establish Victoria\\'s Health Innovation Centre in the Monash  Technology Precinct (MTP). Monash also secured $16.1m of funding via the VHESIF towards smart manufacturing, and  R&D commercialisation. The smart MFG funding will drive commercial and entrepreneurial activity across the MTP.  Monash NEIC - many of the university led precincts are also NEICs. Monash is no exception, described by Invest Victoria  as a \\'thriving hub of health, technology and business precincts, educational institutions and commercial operations\\'.  Monash is Melbourne\\'s largest established national employment and innovation cluster, with a mix of education,  research and industry organisations. As well as being the largest concentration of jobs outside of the CBD, Monash is  viewed as the \\'foundation for the growth of knowledge industries\\'. Focus will be on improving critical economic and  social infrastructure, encouraging new services and businesses to set up and partnership groups to coordinate business  attraction and investment. As with the other NEICs, planning for the Monash NEIC will be done by the VPA in  conjunction with the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions (DJPR).\\n\\n[Aurecon Response to Narrabri SAP Package C Environment and Heritage](https://aurecongroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Knowledge/WinningWork/Aurecon%20Response%20to%20Narrabri%20SAP%20Package%20C%20Environment%20and%20Heritage.pdf):\\n-11     30 \\n\\n[Victorian Precincts Unpacking the opportunities  ](https://aurecongroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Knowledge/Insights/Victorian%20Precincts%20Unpacking%20the%20opportunities%20%20.pdf):\\nMelbourne Connect  •  •  •  •  •  •  The pitch - \\'where great minds connect, and incredible futures emerge\\'. Located in the heart of Melbourne (at the former site of the Royal Women\\'s  Hospital), this is a hub for world-class university expertise and talent, start-ups, SMEs, government and industry. Melbourne Connect brings together digital expertise of industry leaders and Melbourne University under one roof.  Project background - Melbourne Connect (MC) is a \\'purpose built\\' innovation and technology precinct developed by the University of Melbourne in  partnership with a consortium led by Lendlease. The Precinct is  right in the heart of Carlton and next to the Parkville campus and Biomedical precinct. Via  people, place and programs, the idea is that MC will generate digitally driven, data enabled, and socially responsible solutions addressing the big challenges  facing society. MC tenants will be able to expertise in digital technology including AI, data science, and  robotics, drawing on the University\\'s expertise  to  drive innovation and new technologies across all sectors. In terms of the \\'nuts and bolts\\', there are already a bunch of innovation labs under development  specifically designed to tackle these challenges including zero emissions energy, digital twins, digital health and the future of work.   Vision - the vision is for MC to be a \\'gateway to world-changing expertise\\'. By enhancing research and education, MC  will support the vision of Melbourne  as a \\'Knowledge City\\' and play an important role within the Melbourne Innovation Districts (innovation partnership with Melbourne Uni, RMIT and the City   of Melbourne). The plan is for MC to be a \\'digital and data science powerhouse\\' in the heart of the city. It will be home to over 3,000 knowledge workers  from corporate innovation leaders, government, social ventures, start-ups and SMEs alongside diverse digitally focused university expertise, creatives, and  graduate talent. This includes the Telstra Creator Space (a prototyping facility and fabrication space), Science Gallery Melbourne and Melbourne  Entrepreneurial Centre. The new mixed-use precinct will create more than 3,000 direct jobs and more than 5,000 indirect jobs.  Stakeholders - The two key players in this story are \\'host\\' and main delivery vehicle Melbourne Uni and from a financing/investing perspective, Lendlease.   Roles and Responsibilities - the Lendlease consortium comprised Lendlease as developer, builder, co-investor and investment manager of the commercial  space; GIC as major co-investor of the commercial space; Spotless as the facilities manager; and Urbanest as investor and manager of the student  accommodation. Melbourne University is the host and creative hub. The two commercial buildings in the precinct are intended to provide workspace  accommodation for academics, researchers, industry as well as start-ups. The Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology together with its  Fabrication Laboratory and Human Computer Interaction Labs will be have an anchor presence in this precinct, utilising office spaces across 8 floors of the  high raise commercial building. Interestingly, as Melbourne Uni\\'s \\'development partner\\', AECOM was heavily involved in the design and technical  construction advisory of the project. Melbourne Uni  also has a strategic partnership with Invest VIC. The intent is for the two organisations to collaborate to  identify and attract new and strategic FDI with the potential to be located at priority precincts (including MC).  Funding - once again, this is a mix of public and private capital. Lendlease is supplying a lot of the MC development capital together with a consortium of  investors. Project value was estimated at $425m, covering design, construct and maintain over the 40 year + lifecycle.  What about Government? The VIC  Government has contributed start-up capital to establish several of the innovation labs. The $15.2m package will help establish the Zero Emissions Energy  Lab and the Digital Twin Data Visualisation Lab - a visual workspace for major infrastructure project collaboration, and the Digital Health Validtron that will  replicate clinical and home environments for the development of medical devices. While it\\'s not explicit, the likelihood is that this State funding came from  the Victorian Higher Education State Investment Fund, set up in response to the significant impact of the pandemic on the education sector. The presence of  the Melbourne Entrepreneurial Centre at MC also suggests some funding from the Melbourne Accelerator Program (MAP).  MAP has raised over $250m and  invested in over 240 start-ups since inception in 2012. MAP is a 5-month full-time program which provides start-ups with $20,000 in equity-free funding,  free office space in the CBD, structured mentoring by entrepreneurs and business leaders, and pitching opportunities to investors and business leaders in  Australia and overseas. The VIC state Government also invested $124m to strengthen Australia\\'s capability in AI, including the establishment of a National AI  Centre led by Victorian-based CSIRO Data 61 in the Melbourne Connect Precinct\\n\\n[ identifying opportunities May 2021](https://aurecongroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Knowledge/Insights/Australia\\'s%20research%20sector%20-%20identifying%20opportunities%20May%202021.pdf):\\nVIC Precincts  •  •  •  •  •  •  VIC also has several innovation precincts, defined by the Vic Planning Authority as  \"areas where leading-edge anchor institutions and companies cluster and connect  with start-ups, business incubators and accelerators.\"   As with NSW, there\\'s a very strong research narrative at play. They touch similar  research-intensive sectors too - health, education, Aerospace & Defence and  Advanced Manufacturing.....the interplay of science and industry.  Melbourne Biomedical Precinct  - biomedical innovation and research precinct in  Parkville.

Located in the MBP, Illumina and the  University of Melbourne have partnered to establish the Illumina-University of  Melbourne Genomics Hub - the first in the Asia Pacific - which will bring together  the best of genomic expertise and technology in Australia.  Arden - knowledge and innovation hub for life sciences, health, digital technology  and education in Melbourne. Arden is an urban renewal precinct with a strong  research and innovation focus.  Intent is to compliment the neighbouring Parkville  biomedical innovation and research precinct and turn North Melbourne into an  employment hub for science, health, education and digital technology.  Melbourne Connect - purpose built innovation precinct being developed by the  University of Melbourne in partnership with a consortium led by Lendlease.  Located within an innovation cluster, Melbourne Connect will be a place to co- locate and collaborate with world-leaders in deep tech and digital futures research.  Areas of focus will be AI, autonomous systems, sustainable infrastructure,  renewable energy and information systems.  Fisherman\\'s Bend Employment Precinct - creating 21st century jobs centred on  innovation, entrepreneurship and design excellence in manufacturing. T he  presence of world-leading engineering and design research alongside start-ups,  scale-ups, investors and world-leading industry partners will turbo charge the  collaboration and partnerships that drive innovation.\\n\\n[ identifying opportunities May 2021](https://aurecongroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Knowledge/Insights/Australia\\'s%20research%20sector%20-%20identifying%20opportunities%20May%202021.pdf):\\nNSW Precincts  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  One feature of the \\'innovation economy\\' has been the increasing importance of  concentrating businesses in specific geographic areas to match skills, to collaborate, or to  share knowledge and resources in a cost-effective way.   Innovation precincts are emerging in cities, in regions and in greenfield and brownfield  developments. These precincts are frequently centred around universities, research  intensive local health districts, major infrastructure or significant research facilities, such as  the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) facility.   ANSTO Innovation Precinct - based in South Sydney, this is a good example of industry  connecting with science, giving business an opportunity to access outstanding facilities and  expertise. . The ANSTO Place Strategy, designed by the Greater Sydney Commission, will  see ANSTO\\'s Lucas Heights campus transform into Sydney\\'s most promising nexus  connecting industry with science to deliver innovation and jobs of the future for southern  Sydney.  Advanced Manufacturing Research Facility (AMRF)  - part of the Western Sydney  Aerotropolis and located in the STEM intensive Western Parkland City. The precinct will  include the AMRF, the CSIRO facility and other facilities designed to fuel innovation. One of  the UK\\'s leading research facilities, the University of Sheffield\\'s Advanced Manufacturing  Research Centre (AMRC) is a foundation partner at the Aerotropolis. We\\'re likely to see  3D  printers, next generation computing, and interactive spaces designed for advanced  manufacturing, aerospace and defence.   Health Innovation Precincts - several developing around some of the major research  hospitals and universities, including the Randwick Health and Education Precincts, the  Westmead Health and Education Precinct and the Camperdown Ultimo Health and  Education Precinct. These have built an active network of medical research institutions,  ancillary facilities and a mix of complementary industry tenants. The NSW Government is  investing $25m to build an advanced viral vector manufacturing facility at the Westmead  Health Precinct.   Education innovation precincts - Innovation precincts are developing around universities in  NSW, including regional precincts around the University of New England in Armidale and  the Charles Sturt University campuses in Bathurst and Wagga Wagga. Precincts leverage  research strengths and assets to attract business and investment across a range of  disciplines that include digital technology, biotechnology, agricultural technology, and  creative industries.

A key function of the metro station will be to facilitate interchange  with the existing Eastern Suburbs and Illawarra line platforms at Martin Place Station. Customer  experience is the highest priority and is delivered in a manner that not only respects but enhances the civic  environment of Martin Place. Key to the success of the design is the delivery of destination spaces that  create memorable experiences, places to meet by plan or by chance encounter, a station and urban realm  that are framed by contextually respectful architecture.

The 27-storey workplace is conceived as a series of double-height tenancies each benefiting from the  spatial volume, character and amenity brought about by the twin floor plate coupling with the potential for  individual tenancy modules to be vertically connected for larger tenants looking to secure four or more  floors within the tower   Relevance: Wayne is the Technical Director for this future focussed tower integrated into Sydney\\'s new  creative commercial district. The project was won via a Design Excellence Competition.   Monash Woodside Building for Technology and Design | Melbourne, Australia | Monash University /  Lendlease | 2016 - 2020 | $163m | Technical Director   The Woodside Building for Technology and Design is a transformational learning and teaching building for  Monash University within the native landscapes of their Clayton Campus in Melbourne. A transdisciplinary  facility for the Faculties of Engineering and Information Technology, it initiates new models of learning  alongside academic research with industry-related enterprise, while simultaneously integrating precedent- establishing environmental innovation. Certified PassivHaus, the building is a pilot of leadership in learning  environments with immersive and interactive technology and additive and advanced manufacturing  laboratory spaces for students and researchers to embrace innovation, design and cutting-edge technology  for new solutions in sustainable energy technology.   Relevance: Wayne was the Technical Director overseeing the technical resolution of key packages and  played a key role in working towards the achievement of Passvhaus.   Arthur Phillip High School and Parramatta Public School | Sydney, Australia | Schools  Infrastructure NSW / Watpac | 2015 - 2020 | $250m | Technical Director    The integrated redevelopment of Arthur Phillip High School and Parramatta Public School is a landmark  education precinct in Sydney, Australia. The Project is NSW\\'s first prototype for future-focussed schools in  a purpose-designed vertically integrated high-rise building with associated primary school, through an  aligned consultation and pedagogical development process within the Department of Education; it provides  the benchmark for all future projects. The distinctive achievement of the Schools arises from their  precedent-setting configuration where new spatial models for learning in distinct student communities  occur over multiple levels. Spaces within the 17-storey high school are dimensioned and designed to offer  maximum reconfigurability and flexibility in use, with a \\'kit-of-parts\\' approach to furniture and spatial  elements that accommodate a variety of learning styles and facilities.

Client: Macquarie Group/Lendlease     Project description   Construction value: $1.2 billion   Relevant experience this project demonstrates to the  CPRP   Added Value   Grimshaw integrated design approach sought to extract  from the most complex of constraints, a station  proposition of great clarity that enabled the optimisation  of value with affordability, reducing risk through complex  civil, structural and services design and realising social  and commercial benefit.    The connection of the north and south station entries at  the \\'B2\" level with a concourse under the heritage  building of Macquarie Bank\\'s HQ enabled the station to  achieve the functional criteria of world\\'s best practice. In  addition, by integrating the stations operational  infrastructure and services into vertically-stacked plant  and utility risers of the towers above, the demarcating  horizontal strata of services was removed allowing the  creation of a substantial six-storey atria illuminated in  northern light, to extend down to platform level; the public  realm of Martin Place to extend through the ground plane  intersecting to the south with a traverse of concourses,  arcades and halls that move through and celebrate that  connection into the City\\'s basement level public realm  and which give experience to the heritage of Martin  Place.   The proposal instigates the new Martin Place Metro with  continuous connection into the Eastern Suburbs and  Illawarra lines and bus services with a 100,000 m2  integrated station development, unified by a vibrant,  walkable public realm within the historic, \\'civic heart\\' of  Sydney. The design approach prioritises the commuter  experience from the point of arrival, with two arrival halls  of spectacular volume; a six-storey void from platform  level to street level illuminated by northern sun. This  chamber provides legible and quick paths of egress and  entry, immediately orientating passengers.    The developed proposition provides a contiguous vital  public realm, interconnected concourses, activated  streetscapes, and arrival spaces of spectacular volume  and day-lit environmental amenity, all enlivened with  retail, transit services and cultural opportunities, that add  to the live-ability of the customers, residents and workers  alike. An underground public concourse provides an all- weather walkway from Martin Place to Hunter Street, with  the potential to connect through to O\\'Connell Street. The  Macquarie Scheme recognises the importance of Martin  Place as the civic heart of the city and includes various  elements that sympathetically align with the planned  public domain improvements and future vision for Martin  Place. These include the incorporation of active street  edges and corners on Castlereagh and Elizabeth St\\'s,  which extend to the edges of Martin Place, and are.  activated by integrated retail space, cafés, bars,  restaurants and public spaces. \\n\\n[5 Martin Place Sydney](https://aurecongroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Knowledge/WinningWork/5%20Martin%20Place%20Sydney.pdf):\\n5 Martin Place, Sydney   Aurecon used out-of-the-box thinking for an innovative design and  constructability solution for this heritage project that allowed the impossible  to become possible.

Lifting the structure required recording, careful dismantling and assessment of the timbers so it could be  meticulously reconstructed from new and salvaged timber. A new entrance change rooms and lighting now  improve the amenity of the pool.   Relevance: George was the Lead Heritage Architect on this much-loved public project. the project will see the  baths\\' central pavilion and boardwalk raised 1.25 metres to accommodate rising sea levels, in addition to the  construction of new recycled timber pavilions, amenities, kiosk, and lighting towers. \\n\\n[NON-COMMERCIALS_Central Precinct Renewal Program](https://aurecongroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Knowledge/WinningWork/NON-COMMERCIALS_Central%20Precinct%20Renewal%20Program.pdf):\\n5 Martin Place   Client: CBUS + Dexus   Construction value: $425 million    Relevant experience this project demonstrates to the  CPRP   Like the Central Precinct, this project involved a creative  adaptation of the building, conservation of heritage fabric,  the sensitive introduction of new services and building  code compliance. Similar to Central Precinct, Significant  relationships, spaces and fabric of the existing building  have been revealed, conserved and enhanced, and lost  elements reconstructed and reinterpreted.  The original  central light-well has been reinstated as a light-filled  atrium, providing natural light to the reconstructed lay- light in the Banking Chamber. The new Martin Place  façade reflects and articulates the noble proportions and  materials of the adjoining 1916 building including  sandstone and reclaimed trachyte from the 1968  building. The new ten storey addition has an efficient  innovative steel-framed structure which cantilevers over  the 1916/33 building allowing the existing building to be  free of any structural intervention and reflects the  structure of the 1916 building. The façade detailing  reflects the proportions of the original building.

The  redevelopment of this site comprises three parts:   Refurbishment of the original 1916 building and the 1933  extension through a complete restoration of significant  heritage spaces, elements and fabric and the  \"reintroduction\" of the light well as atrium both to allow  the lay-light over the Banking Chamber to be lit by  natural light but also to provide daylight into the middle of  the large low-rise floor plates. Throughout the upper  floors, new services have been sensitively inserted to  meet contemporary office requirements while revealing  original details.   Redevelopment of the 1968 building with a new façade  which is consistent with and articulates the height, scale,  design concept and noble proportions of the adjoining  1916 building and its detailing and acknowledges the  prominence of this principal façade fronting Martin Place.  The façade materials, including sandstone and reclaimed  trachyte from the 1968, building are harmonious with the  1916 façade building. The re-activation of the ground  plane to Martin Place and Rowe Street was achieved  with the through-site-link between Martin Place and  Rowe Street incorporating the commercial office lobby  and new retail uses fronting Rowe Street.   Ten storey vertical extension on the southeast portion of  the site with an efficient innovative steel-framed structure  which cantilevers over the 1916/33 building allowing the  existing building to be free of any structural intervention  and reflecting the proportions of the original building. The  structural design also delivers a floor plate with minimal  core requirements and expansive column-free floor  space to maximise uninterrupted views and day-light  penetration into the floor plates. The extension glazing  incorporates fritted glazing panels of varying  transparencies in a pattern that is inspired both by the  existing glazing elements and the noble proportions of  the 1916 and 1933 façades. \\n\\n\\n### Question:\\nProvide the location and status of the project named \"5 Martin Place\".', 'gpt_response': 'The project \"5 Martin Place\" is located in Sydney, Australia.

Melbourne Square Stage 2 /  Melbourne / Yarra Park City /  2018-current / $500K / Role:  Vertical Transportation Lead   Melbourne Square stage 2 is a  multiple purpose facility currently  in design. The project consists of  a common podium with 2 towers  above. Tower one is a 39 level 5- star hotel with approximately 600  rooms. The second tower is a  luxury residential building topping  72 levels.   David is the vertical transport lead  responsible for the VT design.  This includes performing traffic  studies, providing spatial advice  to the project team, coordination  with other disciplines and  providing the design specification  for the 20 lifts and 8 escalators.   The design is quite challenging as  it needs to consider multiple traffic  scenarios, special events and  functions.

His team used a generalised journey time model (based on the UK's  Passenger Demand Forecasting Handbook for rail patronage prediction) to prepare  a large number of potential scenarios, and then narrow them down by operational  feasibility. This is relevant to the Auckland context given the requirement to develop  complex patronage forecasts and given the Covid uncertainty that may apply.  Regional Express Rail | Ontario, CA | Deutsche Bahn International | 2019 -  Present | Economic Growth and Timetable Optimisation Lead  Matt is leading the econometric and operational optimisation for DB International's  tender to run the Ontario regional express rail. His team is building innovative  economic growth forecasts and operations research-based optimisation models, in  which an algorithm generates mathematically perfect timetables given a set of  operational constraints. This project evaluates potential rail patronage and operating  concepts up to 2055 for the entire Ontario region, and utilises passenger demand  forecasting handbook 'generalised journey time' models. Lynxx has custom-built  railway optimisation software to maximise economic benefit and minimise costs.  This approach is offered as an innovation to the Auckland RUS/LTPP approach.    Auckland Rail Operations | Auckland | Transdev | 2019 - Present | Operational  Modelling Projects  Matt has been engaged to support Transdev Auckland in its rail operational  modelling, including the provision of live tools to monitor day to day operations in the  control centre and simulation software to predict the KPI of future timetable.  Matt and his team are providing multiple layers of timetable and operational  modelling advice, assessing KPI performance before agreeing to operational  timetables. Lynxx has been able to generate insights not available in traditional  timetabling tools (which are geared much more towards infrastructure evaluation,  than operational KPIs).

Lynxx has been able to generate insights not available in traditional  timetabling tools (which are geared much more towards infrastructure evaluation,  than operational KPIs).   This shows a highly developed understanding of the Auckland network already,  meaning the Lynxx & Aurecon team will benefit from a very rapid deployment of  modelling software and a comprehensive understanding of the end customers.      City Rail Link | Auckland | Transdev | 2020 | Operational Modelling Advice  Matt and the Lynxx team are supporting Transdev, AT and CRLL with operational  modelling and predictions of performance under different CRL timetable models,  including construction blockades.

His team is building innovative  economic growth forecasts and operations research-based optimisation models, in  which an algorithm generates mathematically perfect timetables given a set of  operational constraints. This project evaluates potential rail patronage and operating  concepts up to 2055 for the entire Ontario region, and utilises passenger demand  forecasting handbook \\'generalised journey time\\' models. Lynxx has custom-built  railway optimisation software to maximise economic benefit and minimise costs.  This approach is offered as an innovation to the Auckland RUS/LTPP approach.    Auckland Rail Operations | Auckland | Transdev | 2019 - Present | Operational  Modelling Projects  Matt has been engaged to support Transdev Auckland in its rail operational  modelling, including the provision of live tools to monitor day to day operations in the  control centre and simulation software to predict the KPI of future timetable.  Matt and his team are providing multiple layers of timetable and operational  modelling advice, assessing KPI performance before agreeing to operational  timetables. Lynxx has been able to generate insights not available in traditional  timetabling tools (which are geared much more towards infrastructure evaluation,  than operational KPIs).   This shows a highly developed understanding of the Auckland network already,  meaning the Lynxx & Aurecon team will benefit from a very rapid deployment of  modelling software and a comprehensive understanding of the end customers.      City Rail Link | Auckland | Transdev | 2020 | Operational Modelling Advice  Matt and the Lynxx team are supporting Transdev, AT and CRLL with operational  modelling and predictions of performance under different CRL timetable models,  including construction blockades.

He leads the Asia   Pacific team of Lynxx, a data analytics and operations research consultancy with deep  experience in railway modelling, including through the development of their own simulation  and timetable optimisation software that is now exported to railways across the world.  Through Lynxx, Matt leads complex econometric, statistical & operational advice for railway  clients across the world (including Auckland and Wellington) using advanced analytics tools  and simulation software. He is extremely well versed in the Auckland railway network and in  modelling tools for the planning and performance of railways.   Qualifications and Technical and Management Skills   Position and  Organisation   Managing Director for Asia Pacific, Lynxx   Location   Sydney   •  Master of Science (Economics - dissertation on the link between   railway operational performance and passenger demand),  London   •  Bachelor of Science (Psychology), Otago   Qualifications   •  Bachelor of Commerce (Management, Marketing), Otago   •  Graduate Microcredential (Data Science: Data-Driven Decision   Making), Monash University   •  Prince2 Project Management Foundation   •  European Foundation for Quality Management Assessor   •  Graduate of the Australian Institute of Company Directors   •  Extensive leadership skills (project, people)   Management Skills   •  Programme Management    •  Analysis & interpretation of complex data   Technical Skills   •  Econometrician (railway modelling)   •  Railway operations expert   Contract  Commitment   Fully available throughout project and 100% committed where  required   b (1) Experience   Lower North Island Rolling Stock Business Case | Wellington (remote  delivery) | Greater Wellington Regional Council | 2001 | Demand Modelling  Lead  Matt was engaged to support the Lower North Island rolling stock business case by  developing passenger demand forecasting and advanced operation scenario  mapping. His team used a generalised journey time model (based on the UK's  Passenger Demand Forecasting Handbook for rail patronage prediction) to prepare  a large number of potential scenarios, and then narrow them down by operational  feasibility. This is relevant to the Auckland context given the requirement to develop  complex patronage forecasts and given the Covid uncertainty that may apply.  Regional Express Rail | Ontario, CA | Deutsche Bahn International | 2019 -  Present | Economic Growth and Timetable Optimisation Lead  Matt is leading the econometric and operational optimisation for DB International's  tender to run the Ontario regional express rail. His team is building innovative  economic growth forecasts and operations research-based optimisation models, in  which an algorithm generates mathematically perfect timetables given a set of  operational constraints. This project evaluates potential rail patronage and operating  concepts up to 2055 for the entire Ontario region, and utilises passenger demand  forecasting handbook 'generalised journey time' models. Lynxx has custom-built  railway optimisation software to maximise economic benefit and minimise costs.  This approach is offered as an innovation to the Auckland RUS/LTPP approach.    Auckland Rail Operations | Auckland | Transdev | 2019 - Present | Operational  Modelling Projects  Matt has been engaged to support Transdev Auckland in its rail operational  modelling, including the provision of live tools to monitor day to day operations in the  control centre and simulation software to predict the KPI of future timetable.  Matt and his team are providing multiple layers of timetable and operational  modelling advice, assessing KPI performance before agreeing to operational  timetables. Lynxx has been able to generate insights not available in traditional  timetabling tools (which are geared much more towards infrastructure evaluation,  than operational KPIs).

Based on his understanding, he was able to develop a scheme which allowed for the removal of  columns and created a grand entrance arch in front of the Central Electrical building. It\\'s this knowledge  and experience and methodology of investigation and verification and design skills which can unlock the  potential in the site and, similar to the Central Electrical building entrance, allows the Architectural design  team to explore options previously not considered.   5 Martin Place | Sydney, NSW | Grocon | 2013 - 2015 | $300M | Project Director   For the fourth time in its history, the 5 Martin Place site has been transformed. This time, out-of-the-box  thinking was the key to creating a result that made economic sense, met challenging planning constraints  and remained true to the heritage elements of the site.    The architectural solution was to demolish the 1968 building and construct a new 20-level building. To make  use of all available area and maintain project viability, it was proposed to cantilever nearly half of the building  from Level 11 to Level 20, 22 m over the 1916 and 1933 building.   Drawing on capability and experience in undertaking advanced analyses of building structures, Aurecon  demonstrated to the client that a cantilever solution with a simplified V-shaped bracing on four sides of the  tower would be the best engineering solution for the project. No benchmark design was available to use as  a comparison for this unique solution and Aurecon had to develop a unique set of criteria to predict the  long-term global movement of the tower structure to a high level of accuracy.   Tony oversaw the analysis and design of the structure. The new building was subject to lateral gravity  loads, in addition to conventional wind and earthquake loads. Tony recently received a highly commended  award from the Institution of Structural Engineers\\' Structural Awards 2016 in the international category for  5 Martin Place. He will apply the lessons learned to the work at Central Station.   Relevance: The building fabric of the 2016 and 2033 is similar in nature to the structure of the Central  Terminal building so many of the construction methodologies used at the time are common to Central  Terminal building. Tony adopted a research, investigate and validate process to fully understand the  limitations of the structure which enabled him to inform the design team on what could be achieved.  Complex underpinning was required of some areas and bringing some elements of the structure to current  codes was adopted where possible. This is a great example of Heritage adaptive reuse.   ACT Law Courts | Canberra, ACT | Laing O\\'Rourke | 2017 - 2019 | $100M | Project Director   The new facility accommodates the Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, Magistrates Court and Children\\'s  Court with a four-story new link building joining the existing Magistrates and refurbished Supreme Court  buildings. The new Supreme Court was to be located within the new four-storey building and also occupied  parts of the existing Supreme Court building following its reconfiguration. The existing Supreme Court  building was integrated into the completed facility in a way that retained its heritage value. The new  Supreme Court includes eight courtrooms - five of which will be jury courtrooms.   Tony oversaw the analysis and design of the structure. Due to the requirement to keep the existing  Magistrates Court operational and the strict noise and vibration limitations set by the operating court, off  site manufacture was a key design driver for this project.   Relevance: The Heritage listed existing Magistrate\\'s Court was retained, however an additional floor was  excavated to facilitate additional circulation tunnels under the building. These had to be co-ordinated with  the foundations and structure of the heritage magistrate\\'s court. Some structural documentation was not  available. This required a research, investigate and validate process to fully understand the limitations of  the structure which enabled him to inform the design team on what could be achieved. This all had to be  achieved in an operating live environment.

To make use of all available area and  maintain project viability, it was proposed to  cantilever nearly half of the building from Level 11 to  Level 20, 22m over the 1916 and 1933 building.  Tony oversaw the analysis and design of the  structure. The new building was subject to lateral  gravity loads, in addition to conventional wind and  earthquake loads. Tony recently received a highly  commended award from the Institution of Structural  Engineers\\' Structural Awards 2016 in the  international category for 5 Martin Place. He will  apply the lessons learned to the work at Central  Station.  Key achievements: Drawing on capability and  experience in undertaking advanced analyses of  building structures, Aurecon demonstrated to the  client that a cantilever solution with a simplified V- shaped bracing on four sides of the tower would be  the best engineering solution for the project. No  benchmark design was available to use as a  comparison for this unique solution and Aurecon  had to develop a unique set of criteria to predict the  long-term global movement of the tower structure to  a high level of accuracy.

Barangaroo Ferry Hub | Sydney, NSW | TfNSW |  2016 | Structural Director   Tasks performed: Aurecon was commissioned by  TfNSW to deliver the design of the new ferry hub. In  partnership with Cox Architecture, Aurecon  completed the concept, preliminary and detailed  design of the new ferry hub, which consists of two  new double-sided pontoon wharves, allowing four  operational berthing faces, as well as suitable  passenger waiting areas. Aurecon also undertook  the project\\'s marine geotechnical investigation work.  Key achievements: As Structural Director, Tony  worked closely with Cox to deliver a design that was  principally focused on the customer experience.  Strong commitment to user and multiple  stakeholders\\' requirements were key to the  successful delivery of this project and all  stakeholders needed to be informed of the multiple  benefits and advantages of the design.   Pitt Street Station | Sydney, NSW | CPB/Oxford  Properties | 2020 - 2024 | Lead Structural  Engineer   Tasks performed: Tony is currently the lead  structural engineer on Sydney\\'s Pitt Street Station  and OSD. This will become the city\\'s newest  landmark with a $463 million (OSD not included in  this value) contract awarded to build the new metro  railway station and the buildings above it.  The NSW Government has awarded contracts to a  consortium of Oxford Properties, CPB Contractors  and Grocon to deliver the new station and two new  buildings above to form a vibrant new commercial  and residential hub around Pitt and Bathurst  Streets.  The new station will help shape Sydney city\\'s future,  adding to the vibrancy of the area with new retail  options, rental residential accommodation, world- class office space and a seamless transfer from the  station to the revived streetscape.  A 39-storey commercial office building will be built  above the northern entry to Pitt Street Station, on  Park Street between Pitt and Castlereagh streets.  The office building will accommodate upwards of  3,000 daily occupiers and will boast leading smart  building and sustainability features.  Key achievements: Tony Was able to meet the  complex technical requirements of the client 120- year design life which then had to accommodate the  separate requirements of the Commercial Building  above. There were complex interfaces with multiple  contracts which had to be accommodated.

In New Zealand 97% of business enterprise are SMEs accounting for 30% of the workforce*1 [over 600,000  employees] and almost a third of national GDP. We also know that this is not a static sector, and a  portion of these businesses are seen as rapid growth businesses [increasing physical scale by over 30%  pa]. This is underpinning new forms of commercial property solutions  -  solutions providing high lease  flexibility, 'property as a service' offerings and a new form business community based on co-location,  often referred to as co-working. The uptake of this model both in New Zealand and overseas has seen  co-working property solutions become the fastest growing segment in the commercial property sector.    Not only has the New Zealand coworking sector growth been exceptional over the past seven years, but  the growth in the 2017 year saw new records set, achieving over 25% growth*2. In addition, this growth is  seen as continuing with a further 30% committed co-work space pipeline in Auckland to end of 2019  bringing the total to over 45,000m2 of co-work-oriented office space.*2   This shift, some may say disruption, to the commercial office development sector has been seen globally  ... by the end of 2019 over 2.2 million people are expected to work in more than 22,000 co-working  spaces and an estimated 48million m2 worldwide. This represents an annual increase of 20% of space and  almost 30% of workers operating in this mode.*3    SCENTRE GROUP | Nuffield Street Mixed Use Development - Structural Engineering Services | Aurecon | 26th July 2019       i \\n\\n[10763-Technology Drivers - Software Development and Productisation (Dave Mackenzie)](https://aurecongroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Knowledge/Insights/Technology%20Drivers%20-%20Software%20Development%20and%20Productisation%20%28Dave%20Mackenzie%29.pdf):\\nArchistar Data Centre Site Selection \\n\\n[10801-Interfacing with Contractors during tender, detailed design and construction - dos and don'ts](https://aurecongroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Knowledge/Insights/Interfacing%20with%20Contractors%20during%20tender,%20detailed%20design%20and%20construction%20-%20dos%20and%20don'ts.pdf):\\nSite Engineer with John Paul Construction  1999: The Malting Company, Cork  Ireland  2000: Leisureworld, Cork Ireland  2001: National Software Centre, Cork Ireland\\n\\n[3624-Victorian School Building Authority (VSBA) Arrangement A - Capital Programs Assurance Services (CPAS)_cleansed](https://aurecongroup.sharepoint.com/sites/Knowledge/WinningWork/Victorian%20School%20Building%20Authority%20%28VSBA%29%20Arrangement%20A%20-%20Capital%20Programs%20Assurance%20Services%20%28CPAS%29_cleansed.pdf):\\nSpecialist Advisors   Joseph Presti - Built Environment   With over 20 years in the industry, Joseph's experience assisting government and  private sector leaders to develop, procure and manage built environment projects in  both Australia and overseas including residential, retail, commercial, health, stadia and  public assembly buildings.

Matt is a Chartered Civil Engineer whose  experience has seen him involved with roads, drainage infrastructure, stadia, hospitals,  airports, housing, defence and many other projects through the engineering sectors. Matt also  has experience working on PTA projects such as the Bellevue Railcar Assembly and HV  Facility.   Matt\\'s experience across a wide spectrum of disciplines and projects means that he has a  heavy focus on multi-discipline coordination and an excellent insight to the on-site challenges  that will be faced.   Matt is a capable manager who has led many small and medium projects successfully in both  the built environment and transport sectors since moving to Australia in 2010.  Previously,  whilst living in the UK Matt worked for a major contractor and a leading engineering  consultancy for the 12 years since graduating in Civil Engineering in 1995.   Specific examples of recent  relevant experience   Bellevue Railcar Asembly and  HV Facility / Perth / PTA / 2019 /  $1.6B / Assembly Building Civil  Engineer   Aurecon, in conjunction with Woods  Bagot, Urbis and RLB, are undertaking  the detailed design of the new  Bellevue Railcar Assembly and HV  facility.  This appointment follows the  completion of the concept phase that  submitted documentation to the  Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority  (MRA) for the successful Development  Application.   Aurecon is engaged to develop the  Bellevue site plan through to \"Issued  for Construction\" drawings and to  support the PTA and their contractor  through construction of the Bellevue  facilities.   Matt was responsible for the  coordination of the external pavement  and service elements that interfaced  with the main assembly building.  This  role challenged Matt\\'s wider, multi- disciplinary knowledge and required a  skilled approach to managing multiple  design elements from eternal other  civil engineering parties including rail,  road and earthworks.   Cedric Street Priority Bus Lane /  Stirling WA / Public Transport  Authority / 2016-2017 / Project  Manager and Civil Engineer   The west bound approach to Stirling  Station in Perth required the  introduction of a new dedicated bus  lane to improve the commuter links  through the Stirling area.  Aurecon  developed a new concept and detailed  design for the Glendalough bus  station. Significant impacts to the local  authority\\'s road and cycle network had  to be mitigated, including the  introduction of a new pedestrian /  cycle signalised crossing.

He leads the Asia   Pacific team of Lynxx, a data analytics and operations research consultancy with deep  experience in railway modelling, including through the development of their own simulation  and timetable optimisation software that is now exported to railways across the world.  Through Lynxx, Matt leads complex econometric, statistical & operational advice for railway  clients across the world (including Auckland and Wellington) using advanced analytics tools  and simulation software. He is extremely well versed in the Auckland railway network and in  modelling tools for the planning and performance of railways.

His team used a generalised journey time model (based on the UK\\'s  Passenger Demand Forecasting Handbook for rail patronage prediction) to prepare  a large number of potential scenarios, and then narrow them down by operational  feasibility. This is relevant to the Auckland context given the requirement to develop  complex patronage forecasts and given the Covid uncertainty that may apply.  Regional Express Rail | Ontario, CA | Deutsche Bahn International | 2019 -  Present | Economic Growth and Timetable Optimisation Lead  Matt is leading the econometric and operational optimisation for DB International\\'s  tender to run the Ontario regional express rail. His team is building innovative  economic growth forecasts and operations research-based optimisation models, in  which an algorithm generates mathematically perfect timetables given a set of  operational constraints. This project evaluates potential rail patronage and operating  concepts up to 2055 for the entire Ontario region, and utilises passenger demand  forecasting handbook \\'generalised journey time\\' models. Lynxx has custom-built  railway optimisation software to maximise economic benefit and minimise costs.  This approach is offered as an innovation to the Auckland RUS/LTPP approach.    Auckland Rail Operations | Auckland | Transdev | 2019 - Present | Operational  Modelling Projects  Matt has been engaged to support Transdev Auckland in its rail operational  modelling, including the provision of live tools to monitor day to day operations in the  control centre and simulation software to predict the KPI of future timetable.  Matt and his team are providing multiple layers of timetable and operational  modelling advice, assessing KPI performance before agreeing to operational  timetables. Lynxx has been able to generate insights not available in traditional  timetabling tools (which are geared much more towards infrastructure evaluation,  than operational KPIs).   This shows a highly developed understanding of the Auckland network already,  meaning the Lynxx & Aurecon team will benefit from a very rapid deployment of  modelling software and a comprehensive understanding of the end customers.      City Rail Link | Auckland | Transdev | 2020 | Operational Modelling Advice  Matt and the Lynxx team are supporting Transdev, AT and CRLL with operational  modelling and predictions of performance under different CRL timetable models,  including construction blockades.

He leads the Asia   Pacific team of Lynxx, a data analytics and operations research consultancy with deep  experience in railway modelling, including through the development of their own simulation  and timetable optimisation software that is now exported to railways across the world.  Through Lynxx, Matt leads complex econometric, statistical & operational advice for railway  clients across the world (including Auckland and Wellington) using advanced analytics tools  and simulation software. He is extremely well versed in the Auckland railway network and in  modelling tools for the planning and performance of railways.   Qualifications and Technical and Management Skills   Position and  Organisation   Managing Director for Asia Pacific, Lynxx   Location   Sydney   •  Master of Science (Economics - dissertation on the link between   railway operational performance and passenger demand),  London   •  Bachelor of Science (Psychology), Otago   Qualifications   •  Bachelor of Commerce (Management, Marketing), Otago   •  Graduate Microcredential (Data Science: Data-Driven Decision   Making), Monash University   •  Prince2 Project Management Foundation   •  European Foundation for Quality Management Assessor   •  Graduate of the Australian Institute of Company Directors   •  Extensive leadership skills (project, people)   Management Skills   •  Programme Management    •  Analysis & interpretation of complex data   Technical Skills   •  Econometrician (railway modelling)   •  Railway operations expert   Contract  Commitment   Fully available throughout project and 100% committed where  required   b (1) Experience   Lower North Island Rolling Stock Business Case | Wellington (remote  delivery) | Greater Wellington Regional Council | 2001 | Demand Modelling  Lead  Matt was engaged to support the Lower North Island rolling stock business case by  developing passenger demand forecasting and advanced operation scenario  mapping. His team used a generalised journey time model (based on the UK's  Passenger Demand Forecasting Handbook for rail patronage prediction) to prepare  a large number of potential scenarios, and then narrow them down by operational  feasibility. This is relevant to the Auckland context given the requirement to develop  complex patronage forecasts and given the Covid uncertainty that may apply.  Regional Express Rail | Ontario, CA | Deutsche Bahn International | 2019 -  Present | Economic Growth and Timetable Optimisation Lead  Matt is leading the econometric and operational optimisation for DB International's  tender to run the Ontario regional express rail. His team is building innovative  economic growth forecasts and operations research-based optimisation models, in  which an algorithm generates mathematically perfect timetables given a set of  operational constraints. This project evaluates potential rail patronage and operating  concepts up to 2055 for the entire Ontario region, and utilises passenger demand  forecasting handbook 'generalised journey time' models. Lynxx has custom-built  railway optimisation software to maximise economic benefit and minimise costs.  This approach is offered as an innovation to the Auckland RUS/LTPP approach.    Auckland Rail Operations | Auckland | Transdev | 2019 - Present | Operational  Modelling Projects  Matt has been engaged to support Transdev Auckland in its rail operational  modelling, including the provision of live tools to monitor day to day operations in the  control centre and simulation software to predict the KPI of future timetable.  Matt and his team are providing multiple layers of timetable and operational  modelling advice, assessing KPI performance before agreeing to operational  timetables. Lynxx has been able to generate insights not available in traditional  timetabling tools (which are geared much more towards infrastructure evaluation,  than operational KPIs).   This shows a highly developed understanding of the Auckland network already,  meaning the Lynxx & Aurecon team will benefit from a very rapid deployment of  modelling software and a comprehensive understanding of the end customers.      City Rail Link | Auckland | Transdev | 2020 | Operational Modelling Advice  Matt and the Lynxx team are supporting Transdev, AT and CRLL with operational  modelling and predictions of performance under different CRL timetable models,  including construction blockades.

Through Lynxx, Matt leads complex econometric, statistical & operational advice for railway  clients across the world (including Auckland and Wellington) using advanced analytics tools  and simulation software.

His team used a generalised journey time model (based on the UK's  Passenger Demand Forecasting Handbook for rail patronage prediction) to prepare  a large number of potential scenarios, and then narrow them down by operational  feasibility. This is relevant to the Auckland context given the requirement to develop  complex patronage forecasts and given the Covid uncertainty that may apply.  Regional Express Rail | Ontario, CA | Deutsche Bahn International | 2019 -  Present | Economic Growth and Timetable Optimisation Lead  Matt is leading the econometric and operational optimisation for DB International's  tender to run the Ontario regional express rail. His team is building innovative  economic growth forecasts and operations research-based optimisation models, in  which an algorithm generates mathematically perfect timetables given a set of  operational constraints. This project evaluates potential rail patronage and operating  concepts up to 2055 for the entire Ontario region, and utilises passenger demand  forecasting handbook 'generalised journey time' models. Lynxx has custom-built  railway optimisation software to maximise economic benefit and minimise costs.  This approach is offered as an innovation to the Auckland RUS/LTPP approach.    Auckland Rail Operations | Auckland | Transdev | 2019 - Present | Operational  Modelling Projects  Matt has been engaged to support Transdev Auckland in its rail operational  modelling, including the provision of live tools to monitor day to day operations in the  control centre and simulation software to predict the KPI of future timetable.  Matt and his team are providing multiple layers of timetable and operational  modelling advice, assessing KPI performance before agreeing to operational  timetables. Lynxx has been able to generate insights not available in traditional  timetabling tools (which are geared much more towards infrastructure evaluation,  than operational KPIs).   This shows a highly developed understanding of the Auckland network already,  meaning the Lynxx & Aurecon team will benefit from a very rapid deployment of  modelling software and a comprehensive understanding of the end customers.      City Rail Link | Auckland | Transdev | 2020 | Operational Modelling Advice  Matt and the Lynxx team are supporting Transdev, AT and CRLL with operational  modelling and predictions of performance under different CRL timetable models,  including construction blockades.

He leads the Asia   Pacific team of Lynxx, a data analytics and operations research consultancy with deep  experience in railway modelling, including through the development of their own simulation  and timetable optimisation software that is now exported to railways across the world.  Through Lynxx, Matt leads complex econometric, statistical & operational advice for railway  clients across the world (including Auckland and Wellington) using advanced analytics tools  and simulation software. He is extremely well versed in the Auckland railway network and in  modelling tools for the planning and performance of railways.

His team used a generalised journey time model (based on the UK's  Passenger Demand Forecasting Handbook for rail patronage prediction) to prepare  a large number of potential scenarios, and then narrow them down by operational  feasibility. This is relevant to the Auckland context given the requirement to develop  complex patronage forecasts and given the Covid uncertainty that may apply.  Regional Express Rail | Ontario, CA | Deutsche Bahn International | 2019 -  Present | Economic Growth and Timetable Optimisation Lead  Matt is leading the econometric and operational optimisation for DB International's  tender to run the Ontario regional express rail. His team is building innovative  economic growth forecasts and operations research-based optimisation models, in  which an algorithm generates mathematically perfect timetables given a set of  operational constraints. This project evaluates potential rail patronage and operating  concepts up to 2055 for the entire Ontario region, and utilises passenger demand  forecasting handbook 'generalised journey time' models. Lynxx has custom-built  railway optimisation software to maximise economic benefit and minimise costs.  This approach is offered as an innovation to the Auckland RUS/LTPP approach.    Auckland Rail Operations | Auckland | Transdev | 2019 - Present | Operational  Modelling Projects  Matt has been engaged to support Transdev Auckland in its rail operational  modelling, including the provision of live tools to monitor day to day operations in the  control centre and simulation software to predict the KPI of future timetable.  Matt and his team are providing multiple layers of timetable and operational  modelling advice, assessing KPI performance before agreeing to operational  timetables. Lynxx has been able to generate insights not available in traditional  timetabling tools (which are geared much more towards infrastructure evaluation,  than operational KPIs).   This shows a highly developed understanding of the Auckland network already,  meaning the Lynxx & Aurecon team will benefit from a very rapid deployment of  modelling software and a comprehensive understanding of the end customers.      City Rail Link | Auckland | Transdev | 2020 | Operational Modelling Advice  Matt and the Lynxx team are supporting Transdev, AT and CRLL with operational  modelling and predictions of performance under different CRL timetable models,  including construction blockades.

If you could  provide some further details about the  location and scope of the work, that would  be useful.

Thanks for getting back to me promptly.  The work is likely to take 1-2 days, would  involve field survey, and was planned for  somewhere in the week of 24 September.   We could try and arrange this for Thursday  and Friday 27 and 28 September, but  would this give enough notice to site  officers with the FRG on the 26th?  I\"ll check with First Sun if they\"re happy to  organise payment for site officers.   Thanks Jo.  I will have a discussion with  Annika Rotumah, our Community  Facilitator, when she is in the office  tomorrow about the best logistical means  to proceed.   Thanks Tori    I\"ve had a last-minute cancellation for next  week, and there\"s a possibility for us to do  a quick survey of a potential ancillary area  near a women\"s site near New Italy, I was  wondering if there might be a possibility to  arrange to get Veronica Wilson and/or Kim  Wilson, and/or another female member of  Bandjalang People out to look at this area  next week (17-21 September) sometime?   I realise this is before the preferred date of  the FRG meeting you mentioned on the  26th, but thought I\"d check.  At this stage  we\"re pretty flexible with timing next week,  just not Wednesday morning, but we could  do pretty much any time Monday,  Tuesday, Weds afternoon, Thursday or  Friday.  We also need to invite Bogal  LALC, so timing may be somewhat  constrained depending on their availability  too.  I haven\"t heard back from First Sun yet,  but another possibility we could explore for  getting Bandjalang People site officers  paid would potentially be through Bogal  LALC - I\"m speaking to Lance Manton  (CEO) this afternoon and could run this by  him.   NTSCORP has spoken to Kim & Bonnie  Wilson, and to Aunty Gwen Hickling, who  have given their consent for us to pass on  their contact details to you to facilitate this  work next week at a suitable time.
